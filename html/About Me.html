                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <h5>Sophomore Computer Science Major</h5>
                <p>Hello! My name is Kartik Vanjani and I am a sophomore at Hunter College
                    pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. My experience so far
                    involves multiple things. I am fully proficient in object oriented languages
                    like Java, Python, and C++. I also have experience in cybersecurity through
                    pursuing a Google career certificate in the field, and additional experience 
                    in web development through my internship at Art Beyond Sight. At this point in my career, all I am looking for is potential
                    for growth, and having my work impact the world positively. That is my utmost goal,
                    and I won't stop working until I achieve it! Below is my resume, and if any qualifications
                match I would love it if you could reach out!</p>
